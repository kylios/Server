facebook API constant feed/cache thing
    -connect to server from php code and request a certain facebook ID
    -server will then ping facebook semi-regularly and get userdata so it is ready
    in cache for php code
    -php code always queries server for this data
    -server will fetch new data from facebook on-demand for php code
    -server will keep cached copies of previously requested facebook data in memory
    for X amount of time (alternately use memcached - probably better/easier) and
    use that instead of going back to facebook to return the data to php
